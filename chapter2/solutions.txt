1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
>>>> Ans(i): True and False
        (ii) True and False

2. What are the three Boolean operators:
>>>> Ans: and, or, not are the three boolean operators

3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every 
    possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what 
    they evaluate to).
==>> Ans: Boolean Operator combination      Result
            True and True                   True
            True and False                  False
            False and True                  False
            False and False                 False
            True or True                    True
            True or False                   True
            False or True                   True
            False or False                  False

4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?
    (5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
==>> Ans: False
    not (5 > 4) 
==>> Ans: False
    (5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
==>> Ans: True
    not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
==>> Ans: False
    (True and True) and (True == False)
==>> Ans: False
    (not False) or (not True)
==>> Ans: True
5. What are the six conparison operators?
==>> Ans: <, >, =<, =>, !=, ==
6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?
==> The assignment operator'=' assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left while the equal to'==' operator checks if the two given operands are equal
7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one
==>> Ans: A condition is a statement that must be fulfilled before particular actions can be executed in program.
10. What can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?
==>> Ans: Control 'c' can be used to break out of an infinite loop
11. What is the difference between break and continue:
==>> Ans: 'break' is used for immediate termination of the loop and continue runs the next instance of the whle loop(kinda starts runnin the while loop from the top) 
12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)
    in a for loop? 
==>> range(10) provides 10 values, 0 through to 9, range(1,10) provides 9 values, 1 through to 9 while range(0,10,1)
    also provides 10 values 0 through to 9 with the third character being the stepsize
14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how 
    would you call it after importing spam?
==>> Ans: spam.bacon()
